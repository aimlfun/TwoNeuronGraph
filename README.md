# TwoNeuronGraph
Plot graph of 1 input/output 2 hidden neurons, you choose weightings / biases.

This was born out of a blog posting (to be published in June), discussing points around an article written by Stephen Wolfram (of Wolfram Alpha fame). In that article, he discusses training a neural network with a single input, 2 hidden layers, and a single output, to match a (kind of) square graph, taking more than 1 million epochs, and how you cannot train 2 hidden layers to do it. Or at least that is my take on what he wrote.
 
So, I built app to investigate this, and I found that you can actually train 2 hidden layers to do it, and the epochs were low...

That got me curious. Wouldn't it be cool to see the graph of the neural network, and see how the weights and biases affect the graph? So I built this app.
 
You can edit the weightings and biases, and the graph will update!
